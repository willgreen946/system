This is all of Will Rollitt's configuration files for *nix systems
Some things like wallpapers and picom.conf will likely be updated alot

Using the configs:
For most of them just put the .config directory in your /home/*username*/ directory.
If you cant see the .config directory use 'ls -a' to see it or in some file managers use
'ctrl+h' to see the directory.

For .bashrc you need to copy or move it to your /home/*username*/ directory
